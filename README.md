RAVI NEWLY ADDED FUNCTIONALITY FILES
The problem statement for this project is the inability of visually impaired students to understand STEM material due to their inability to see figures which describe experiments or provide illustrations. <br>
The solution proposed in this project is to develop an automated tool for converting inaccessible STEM documents into an accessible format that can be understood by visually impaired students just by hearing in the same way as a normal student understands it by reading.
The project includes two main components: 
The previously made RAVI tools and a web application for crowdsourcing image description. 
The RAVI tools refine HTML output to make it accessible to screen readers, while the web application allows users to contribute image descriptions(ALT TEXT)  to make Images in the STEM material more accessible to visually impaired students. 
The work was to make it automated image description or ALT TEXT so that it makes easy for the visually impaired for studying.
The project aims to integrate these components to achieve the final goal of creating an automated tool for converting inaccessible STEM documents into an accessible format.
